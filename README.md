My name is Jonathan Lai and I want to know, which bars are worth a taxi ride?

Its nearing 9PM; the markets are closed and your coworkers want to grab a pint.  Where do you go?

By correlating data from taxis, Uber, and Lyft RIDEs with the geolocation of all
 of the bars and nightclubs in NYC, I can DETERMINE which nighttime venues are the most popular.

And by tying in Google ratings and map services, I can provide the end user with an app to find the best bar closest to them.

While I think this is a nifty project for people like you and me trying to figure out what to do on a Friday night, I think the customers who would benefit most from this work are the bar owners and commercial real estate developers.

On the backend of my project, I have developed tools to predict the number of potential customers and nightly gross profit to identify market leaders in the bar business.

Simultaneously, I have integrated commercial property pricing to find the best spots in NYC to open a new bars with the best return on investmentâ€”especially during the critical initial years for every new bar.

With this framework in place, I hope to incorporate forecasting tools to estimate bar profitability trends and give my tools commericalizable predictive power.

So its nearing 9PM and you are probably wondering which bars are worth a taxi ride?

Here is a short list.
